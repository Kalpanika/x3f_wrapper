X3F Wrapper
-----------


This project offers the ability to quickly convert a directory filled with X3F images into jpgs, tiffs, or dng files, using the Kalpanika X3F Tools executable.  In addition, this tool will copy exif information from the source file into the final image.

To set it up:

1) Download the binary file.  (Only windows at this point, Mac and Linux coming soon).
2) Download the exif tools executable ([http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/]http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/)
3) When you first open the app, you will be prompted to provide X3F Extract tools location, as well as the exif tools location.  The default binary release contains the 64 bit windows release, but you will need to set the location you downloaded in step 2.
4) Set up the other parameters (denoising, file output type, etc).

To run it:
Either double click on individual files, or convert all unprocessed images via the button in the bottom right.

Please let us know if you have any issues with the conversion!
